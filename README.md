As my 3rd homework assignment with Coding Bootcamp, I set out to create a site that will generate a password with a few user prompts.

The criteria in the assignment first set the numerical length of the password, between 8-128 numbers. In addition, the password will include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and at least one special character.

Our team set out to create prompts for the user to initiate the password, and Var as Arrays which are used to compare with User input.

Our Generate Password button prompts user to enter number between 8-128 or sends them back to try again.

When user enters number 8-128, they are given series of prompts which is stored, and we are set up to have this cycle occur only once.

A series of conditions are set up so if user inputs Confirm (or "True") to prompts (do you want a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, number, special character), function will push one of each category to generating password, and using MathRandom to random generate more numbers to add to end of password.

We are then set to display a generated password for user.
