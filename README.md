In this homework assignment, I am updating my portfolio to include reference to my first group project, "Pet City."

I have kept much of the same design for now and will be revisitng time and again for refactor. Given the timing to submit the assignment and my new famiiarity with the phrase MVP, I'm going to get this up to Github and submitted for now. 

To note–my first approach was to take my original repo and refactor from there. However, as I was still new to the push/pull process when I submitted the original portfolio project, I may have deleted that first folder (and have less up to date backups of that original submission).

Github being what it is, I was happy to download a zip file and go from there in a new repo.

One note–when I first created this project, I thought it would be clever to include a in the Portfolio.html, a dropdown "details" but I"ll probably get rid of that, work on the formatting, clear out the non-coding related material I was using as placeholders.
